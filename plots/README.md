# Charts Generation 

To generate the graphs using the script provided here it is necessary to have access to a module named 'matplotx'. In case you use conda as myself, you can download it as `conda install -c conda-forge matplotx`, or in other case simply run `pip install matplotx[all]`. The package works simply and basically the same as Matplotlib, but it contains styles and some different functionality.

After ensuring the installation of this package, just run the `generate-svgs.py` file and then the graphics will appear in this directory, with paths automatically linked to the readme display on the home page of this repository.
